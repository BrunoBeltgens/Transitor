# BCS Project 1-2 Group 23



## SETUP
- [ ] If running on VSCode, run the app configuration under */.vscode/launch.json*
- [ ] In case any library fails to be imported automatically, they are all under */lib*
- [ ] Our database is hosted on a free server, so you shouldn't need to set up anything related to it.
  - In case it doesn't work, though, a dump of our database is provided: *databaseDump.sql* in the root

## START
- [ ] To start the application, run *EntryPoint.java* under *src/App*

## OTHER CODE
- [ ] The code to generate the accessibility scores for each post code is under Accessibility.PostCodeRanker.
  - It does not interact with the rest of the program, you have to run it manually, as you only really need to rank the post codes once.
